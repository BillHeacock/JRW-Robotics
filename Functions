          The presets are "frontlimit", "sidelimit"
          
goStraight    This sets the motors to go straight at the prest speed.

              This reading in in millimeters

OLED        This funtion formats and displays readings on the Display.
            If the reading exceeds 800mm, the display will read "C" for clear
            It also displays the buttons and their status
            

serialMonitor   This can be used to help troubleshoot
                It should not be used for normal operation as it slows down things too much

initializeDisplay     These last 3 functions goes through the setup out inputs and outputs
initializeSensors     They are only run once. When we power it up or hit the reset button.
