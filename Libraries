There are several libraries used in this sketch. Below are some links to help understand what they can do.
The idea was to have these tool available while developing the ability to navigate a maze.
There may be better options out there, but this is a start.

<PID_v1.h>      Algorithm that makes small adjustments to motor power in order to achieve more precise and smooth robot movement
<Smoothed.h>    Smooth the lidar readings  https://github.com/MattFryer/Smoothed
                https://github.com/br3ttb/Arduino-PID-Library
<ezButton.h>    Debounces buttons and more  https://github.com/ArduinoGetStarted/button
<Adafruit_SSD1306.h> OLED Library (adafruit) https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SSD1306
<VL53L0X.h>     Lidar library (Pololu)  https://github.com/pololu/vl53l0x-arduino
<Wire.h>        I2C communication library. Both the OLED and the Lidars use I2C to communicate with the Arduino
                It's convienent since it uses just 2 wires (plus power and ground)
