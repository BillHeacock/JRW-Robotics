This Sketch is designed to be used to make an autonomous robot that can navigate a maze. 
It uses three sensors to find distances at the front, right and left sides of the robot
Four switches are designed to give the user some flexibility.
Each button can run the robot, each with custom settings.
Lidars use digital pins D8,D9,D10.  You can use most digital pins
20 (SDA), 21 (SCL)
Buttons are set to a high (digital 1), when pushed they go low (digital 0)
Buttons use pins D4,D5,D6,D7. The other side of each button connection connects to ground.
The buttons use the internal pullup resistor built in to the Arduino

Lastly, the program can be monitored with the serial monitor along with (or instead of) the OLED.
However, serial print uses a lot of resources
in the processor and should be commented out for normal operation
